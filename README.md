# EEG_Seizure_Detection

The main objective was to develop a classification model to analyze EEG (Electroencephalogram) data, particularly focusing on detecting epileptic seizures. This involved using advanced machine learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care.

Key Components of the Project:
Data Source and Utilization: We used the Bonn EEG Dataset, which is specially curated for research on epileptic seizures. This dataset allowed our model to specifically target and learn from patterns associated with different brain conditions.

Technology and Techniques: The project combined two sophisticated technologies: UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for reducing data complexity and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, a type of deep learning model, to capture and learn from the temporal patterns in the EEG data.

Outcome and Impact: The successful implementation of this model demonstrated the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy of epilepsy diagnoses, thus facilitating better patient outcomes. This approach not only refined the model's performance but also showcased its adaptability to various EEG datasets, making it a valuable tool for medical research.

Future Directions: Looking ahead, the project lays a foundation for further enhancements such as integrating more complex machine learning models, expanding the dataset, and refining the features extracted to improve both the modelâ€™s accuracy and its application in real-world scenarios.

This project represents a crucial step forward in the use of AI and machine learning in the field of neuroscience, opening up new avenues for diagnosing and understanding neurological disorders more effectively.
